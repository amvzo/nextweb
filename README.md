NextStep/OpenStep Web Browser

NeXTWEB is an attempt to leverage AI to create a new application for vintage operating systems. Ideally this will run on both emulators, as well as, original NeXT Computers. In the future it might also be expendaded to run on Intel 486 Machines and even Sun Sparc machines, and all that were capable of running OpenStep. 

For my part in this, I am a complete and total noob. I mainly have the curiosity and desire to help create something for this amazing community and these machines that became almost a lynch pin to our modern world. With NeXTSTEP becoming the underpinnings of MacOS and iOS, which are a huge part of our computing world, it is important to me, that there be some love given to these systems.

With the help of AI, I decided to ask the questions. Can we build a browser with modern features and access on vintage software and hardware? THe answer was yes. And so I began pulling on the string that ultimately has lead to the creation of this repo, that is meant to be a starting point from which anyone interested can collaborate to help make this dream a reality. 

I will continue to add to this, though there may be a few duplicate files, as I am working with Grok, DeepSeek and ChatGPT Code Pilot (non subscription with daily limits), it is important to review similarly named files to see which applies the code in the best manner. In some cases between Grok and Deepseek (the oldest files uploaded) these will in some cases be merged by me, though not entirely sure if it was done correctly. 

Please leave any notes and todos and I will try to get them updated and fixed. I dont believe this will compile just yet, but I hope we can get to that point. I personally have a working NeXT Turbo Color with a 33MHz CPU 128MB RAM SCSI to SD and internet connection. I am not well versed in compiling but I will do what I can with some guidance. 

I hope you will join me and help to build an awesome new Browser for NeXT Computers and NeXTSTEP/OpenSTEP Operating systems. 

Thank you for you help and consideration,

Andy
